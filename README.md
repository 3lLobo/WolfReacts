# My React notes

This readme fills out as Wolf learns writing React.js Apps.
These are mostly personal notes, in shape and size of brain farts intended for my future self. If you still want to read along, enjoy ðŸ˜¹
Notes:

1. Get started by creating a [node-js-app](https://create-react-app.dev/)
2. [Pseudo elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) on your app
3. [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/getting-started/installation/) for styled elements
4. [Formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview) and yup for simplifying forms 

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

React state, rerenderes elements on change:
```jsx
[obj, setObj] = useState("Obj")

<img src={obj} onClich={setObj(prevObj => prevObj + "change")}>
```
Don't change state of data or received props. Rather copy that data and change the copy.

Things React __**can't**__ handle:
 - local filesystem
 - API interactions
 - subscriptions/websockets
 - syncing internal states
In these cases `useEffect()`. Retrun cleanup function to avoit memory leak

Listen to events with 'window.addEventListener()`


## JS

arrays have a `.map()` function. Use Map instead of for loops
```js
const numbers = [1,2,3]
const sqrd = numbers.map((num) => {
    return num * num
})
```

In props:
if a variable exists then insert whatever:
```js
{var && <h1>{var}</h1>}
```
 
 spreading items:
 ```js
 const items = [0,1,2,3]
 {...items}
 ```
 

Fetch data:
```js
fetch("https://my.api/request")
    .then(res => res.json)
    .then(data => doSome(data))
// or
async function apiCall() {
    const res = await fetch("https://my.api/request")
    const data = await res.json
    doSome(data)
}
```
